There may be diffrent project in your system with diffrent requirement of packages 
Your one project may require pandas version 2.4
So to solve this problem we can use the concept of virtual environment 

Virtual environment is a separate environment in your system where we can install packages in isolated from for each project

#Imported commands 
1. python -m venv <name_of_the_environment>
   eg ; python -m venv venv
        => Creates a new viirtual environment
2. venv\Scripts\activate (for windows devices in commands promps)
   source venv/bin/activate (for mac devices)
        => activate the viirtual environment
3. deactivate 
        => it deactivates the virtual environment
4. pip install<pakage name>
    eg pip install panda
        =>It install tge pakage to the environment
5. pip freeze
        => It shows all the install packages in the environment

6. pip freeze > requirement.txt
        => It Creates a file consisting of all the packages
7. pip install -r requirement
        => Recursively installs all the packages from requirements.txt file
